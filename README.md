# ButtonBox

This is project based on amstudio's BUTTON BOX | 32 FUNCTION w ENCODERS (https://youtu.be/Z7Sc4MJ8RPM).

What I have done is modified code so that some buttons actually work as keyboard arrows, esc, backspace and enter keys. Those still are visible as gamecontroller buttons but they instead of sending signal of button press they send keyboard key presses.

Also there is Qucs "Quite universal circuit simulator" (http://qucs.sourceforge.net/) project of my wiring plan.

Also there is my version of layout plan.
